          <p class="paragraph">
            Canada, the second-largest country in the world, is celebrated for its expansive and diverse natural landscapes. From the icy Arctic tundra in the north to the rugged Rocky Mountains and lush, verdant forests, each province offers a unique set of breathtaking scenery. Along the Atlantic coast, the maritime provinces showcase rugged cliffs and quaint fishing villages, while the western coast boasts rainforests and picturesque islands. The central plains feature vast, open prairies, and the far north is marked by the mystical aurora borealis lighting up the night sky. This rich mosaic of environments not only defines Canada's geographic character but also highlights its vast cultural heritage, intertwining with its national identity. The immense variety of landscapes also supports a wide array of wildlife, from polar bears in the Arctic to moose in the boreal forests, further underscoring the natural wealth of the nation.

          <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Cultural tapestry</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The culture of Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of art, cuisine, and tradition. Indigenous peoples, French and British settlers, and recent immigrants from around the globe have all made their mark. This cultural mosaic is reflected in the vibrant music scenes across the country, from traditional folk and indigenous music to modern pop and hip-hop. Canadian literature and theater also draw heavily from these diverse influences, often exploring themes of identity and cultural intersection.

In terms of cuisine, the influence is equally diverse, ranging from indigenous dishes such as bannock and game meats to poutine, a popular dish with roots in Quebec. The culinary scene is further enriched by contributions from Chinese, Italian, and Indian communities, among others, making Canada a hotspot for food lovers seeking global flavors.
